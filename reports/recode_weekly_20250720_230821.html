We review the emerging intersection between IEIs and neurological diseases, spanning neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative manifestations. We discuss how genetic overlaps between immunity and Îáå development-for example, defects in DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, or cytokine signaling-can lead to combined immunological and neurological phenotypes...</p>
