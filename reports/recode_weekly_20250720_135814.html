We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar up to December 18, 2024, for meta-analyses of observational studies examining biomarkers for AD. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. We recalculated effect sizes using random-effects models ...</p>
