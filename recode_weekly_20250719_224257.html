                        <p>Widespread methamphetamine (meth) misuse remains a worldwide public health issue that lacks effective clinical treatment. Besides the high relapse and overdose rates, chronic meth use produces a spectrum of cognitive deficits that further complicate treatment and recovery. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGlu3) attenuates drug-seeking behavior and/or improves cognition in several animal models, though its ability to improve meth-associated behavioral deficits has not been explor...</p>

To optimally detect mild cognitive impairment or dementia, extensive neuropsychological assessment is essential. A wide range of cognitive tests and clinical outcome assessments have been used in clinical settings, often without regard to their clinimetric quality.
